Transform the following inference code into a class that implements the ModelInterface:

class ModelInterface:
    def load_model(self) -> None:
        pass

    def unload_model(self) -> None:
        pass

    def run_inference(self, input_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        pass

The class should be named after the model (e.g., PixtralModel) and should:
1. Implement the load_model method to initialize the model and any necessary components.
2. Implement the unload_model method to free up resources.
3. Implement the run_inference method to perform the inference using the input_data.
4. Use type hints and follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
5. Handle any necessary error cases.

Here's the original inference code to transform:

{original_code}

Please provide the transformed code that implements the ModelInterface.
